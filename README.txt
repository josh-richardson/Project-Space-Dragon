This game was written in 48 hours by four people, including myself, at the University of Glasgow Hackathon 2015. The code is awful, but the game is reasonably playable. Assume most of the stuff that looks halfway decent wasn't written by me. Heh.

You'll need to install pygame and various other libraries to make it work. A 64-bit version of pygame is available at http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame

It's worth mentioning that none of us had ever used python before (though we all had programming experience in other languages).
